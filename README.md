In today’s world, the fashion industry has a strong importance in people’s lives. The fashion industry say to the society what to wear and creates new types of clothes all the time.  
Some people claim that the fashion industry has a bad effect on people’s lives, they say that the fashion industry creates clothes that the society has to wear. Furthermore, the clothes’ price is extremely high and people, who can’t afford it, should not be in the society.  
In the other hand, the fashion industry guide the people to be in a good appearance, because, nowadays, the appearance of the person is more important than the person itself.  
In my opinion, the fashion industry doesn’t has a bad influence on people’s lives. It’s something which was created to help people what to wear.

The best time of the day which I like the most is during the evening, like around 5 or 6 PM. I usually have uh some snacks, or sometimes I have to make plans to go hang out with my friends. Like we can go to uh some eatery, or go to watch a film in the cinema. And then when I come back home, I like to spend time playing with my younger sister or just enjoy reading my favourite comics.

### Task: Automatic speaking assessment
**1. Using an LLM, write a prompt to perform automatic speaking performance assessment on three aspects: fluency, language use and pronunciation. Ask the LLM to try to guess the learner’s L1 and provide reasons for its decision.  
2. Upload an audio file or (record yourself reading aloud). Is the assessment accurate?**  


## Speech synthesis (text to speech)
### Task: Improving pronunciation
**Using an LLM, create sentences that focus on common aspects of pronunciation that learners often find difficult (e.g. short vs long vowels). Next, generate model spoken versions using a TTS service.**  

### Task: Creating your own speaking scripts  
**Create a listening comprehension question consisting of a dialogue between three people with different accents.  
1. Create a short dialogue and question.  
2. Create an audio file for each turn of the conversation using a TTS service.  
3. Join all the audio files together.**
